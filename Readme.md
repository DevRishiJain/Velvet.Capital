**Problem Statement 1 - Account Abstraction Contract:**

Design and write an account abstraction contract that enables two parties: a vault manager and a user. The vault manager should be able to bundle transactions on behalf of the user and perform various actions like trading, swapping, and investing using any chosen Automated Market Maker (AMM). Additionally, the user should have the ability to set a maximum limit on what the vault manager can do in terms of trading, without requiring the user's signature for every transaction. The contract should utilize the concept of account abstraction to achieve these functionalities.

**Problem Simplified:-**
Account Abstraction Contract:

Imagine you have a digital savings account, and you want to give permission to someone else (let's call them a "vault manager") to handle your savings on your behalf. This vault manager can make transactions like buying, selling, and investing in different things using a special tool called an Automated Market Maker (AMM), which helps with these transactions. However, you want to control how much the vault manager can do without asking you for permission every time.

To solve this, we need to create a special smart contract (a piece of code that runs on a blockchain) that allows you to set rules for the vault manager. The contract should be smart enough to understand when the vault manager can act freely within the limits you set and when it needs your permission for certain actions. This way, you can be more flexible with your savings while still having control over how it's managed.


**Solution for Problem Statement 1 -**
Account Abstraction Contract:

Step by Step Solution:-

Smart Contract Design:
Define the structure of the Account Abstraction Contract to store user preferences and limits for the vault manager.
Implement functions for the user to set their preferences, such as maximum trading limit and approval for specific actions.
Create functions for the vault manager to execute transactions on behalf of the user while adhering to the set limits.


Integration with an AMM:
Choose a suitable AMM (Automated Market Maker) to perform trading, swapping, and investing operations.
Develop the integration of the selected AMM within the Account Abstraction Contract.


Authentication and Access Control:
Implement mechanisms for authentication to ensure that only the authorized user and vault manager can interact with the contract.
Use access control modifiers to restrict actions according to user preferences and limits.


Security Considerations:
Ensure the contract is robust and secure against potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflow, and others.
Test the contract extensively using various scenarios and edge cases.

**Problem Statement 2 - TWAP Oracle Contract:**

Create a contract that implements a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracle, similar to popular oracles like Chainlink. The contract should use the TWAP concept to develop a strategy for achieving the best yield from any chosen AMM (e.g., Balancer or others). The goal is to create a robust AMM that integrates seamlessly with your AMM product.

**Problem Simplified:-**
TWAP Oracle Contract:

Imagine you want to invest your money in different digital assets, and you want to know the best time to make these investments. To do that, you need to know the average price of these assets over a specific period, like an hour or a day. This average price is called the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP).

To get this information, we need a special contract (like a program) that acts like an intelligent price oracle. This oracle will fetch the average prices of assets from different places, like a popular oracle service (like Chainlink), and then it will use this information to make smart investment decisions. The goal is to use this TWAP oracle with an Automated Market Maker (AMM) tool to get the best returns on your investments, making it a powerful and efficient way to manage your money.


**Solution for Problem Statement 2 -**
TWAP Oracle Contract:

Step by Step Solution:-

TWAP Calculation:
Design and implement a function that calculates the Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) for a given asset over a specified time period.
Decide on the data source to retrieve the price information, either through an external oracle service (e.g., Chainlink) or other on-chain data.


Strategy Selection:
Choose an appropriate investment strategy based on the TWAP data to achieve the best yield from the selected AMM (e.g., Balancer or another AMM).


Smart Contract Design:
Create a contract that holds the TWAP oracle and investment strategy logic.
Allow users to deposit funds into the contract for investment purposes.


Investment Execution:
Implement functions to execute the investment strategy using the TWAP oracle data.
Ensure that investments are performed securely and with minimal slippage.


Risk Management:
Incorporate risk management mechanisms to prevent significant losses during volatile market conditions.
Design safeguards to protect user funds in case of unexpected events.


Integration with AMM:
Integrate the TWAP Oracle Contract with the selected AMM to execute the investment strategy and yield optimization.


Testing and Security:
Conduct thorough testing, including stress testing and security audits, to ensure the contract's reliability and safety
