Detailed explanation to the codes:



Solution-2
Let's go through the code to understand its functionality:

TWAPOracle:
This contract represents a TWAP Oracle, which is responsible for fetching and providing the TWAP price from the chosen AMM protocol.
It has the following state variables:
twapPrice: The latest TWAP price fetched from the AMM protocol.
lastUpdateTime: The timestamp of the last update of the TWAP price.
twapDuration: The duration for which the TWAP price is calculated (usually a specific time window).
The constructor sets the twapDuration when the contract is deployed.
The main function in this contract is updateTWAPPrice, which is used to update the TWAP price. However, the implementation for fetching the TWAP price from the actual AMM protocol is missing, and it is indicated by a comment: "// Implement fetching and updating TWAP price from the chosen AMM protocol."


AMMStrategy:
This contract represents the AMM strategy that utilizes the TWAP Oracle to make decisions based on the historical price data.
It has two state variables:
twapOracle: The address of the TWAP Oracle contract.
ammAddress: The address of the chosen AMM protocol.
The constructor takes the addresses of the TWAP Oracle and the AMM protocol as arguments and initializes the respective contract instances.
The main function in this contract is executeStrategy. It is intended to be called by external actors to execute the AMM strategy based on the TWAP data.
In the executeStrategy function, the TWAP price is obtained by calling twapOracle.getTWAPPrice(). The actual implementation of the AMM strategy based on this TWAP price is missing and is indicated by a comment: "// Implement your AMM strategy here using the TWAP data."
Overall, the code provides a basic framework for creating an AMM strategy that relies on TWAP price data from an external Oracle. However, to make it functional, you need to implement the missing parts:

Implement the fetching of the TWAP price from the actual AMM protocol in the TWAPOracle contract's updateTWAPPrice function.
Implement the AMM strategy based on the TWAP price in the AMMStrategy contract's executeStrategy function.
